# App Store Metadata Confirmation (Guideline 2.3.6)

## In-App Controls / Age Assurance

**CONFIRMATION:** Taatom does **NOT** include:

- Parental controls
- Age assurance or age verification features
- In-app content filtering for parental control purposes
- Any features that would require "In-App Controls" to be selected in App Store Connect

If you incorrectly selected "In-App Controls" or similar metadata in App Store Connect, please update:

1. **App Store Connect → Your App → App Information**
2. Remove any incorrect selections under Age Rating, In-App Purchases, or similar categories
3. Ensure metadata accurately reflects that Taatom is a social travel app with standard user-generated content (posts, profiles) and does not include parental/age-control features

## Resubmission Note

*"We confirm that Taatom does not include parental controls, age assurance, or content filtering intended for parental use. The app is a social travel sharing platform. We have corrected our App Store Connect metadata accordingly."*
